> An intelligent system that predicts multiple diseases using machine learning algorithms and patient data.

## ✨ Overview

Multi-Disease Predictor is an advanced machine learning application designed to assist healthcare professionals in early disease detection. By analyzing patient data points and symptoms, this tool provides probabilistic predictions across multiple medical conditions, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-disease classification**: Simultaneously evaluate risk across multiple conditions
- **Data preprocessing pipeline**: Automated cleaning and feature extraction
- **Interactive visualizations**: Clearly interpret prediction results
- **Configurable models**: Easily switch between different ML algorithms
- **Privacy-focused**: Secure handling of sensitive medical data
